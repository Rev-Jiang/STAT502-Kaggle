Week 10 (March 23-27)  Summary of Activity and Progress
This week we tried to use a simple linear regression model to predict house price but one problem we meet is with this method, 
we may get negative predictions. Itâ€™s commonsense that house price should be positive so we modify our model a little bit to 
be absolute linear regression model. We forced the prediction to be positive to get more reasonable result.
